  Out of the box, once you define a new collection in Tina, its content becomes
  available through the "basic editor".d

  Tina also allows for "Contextual Editing" so that editors can see their pages
  being updated in real-time as they make changes

  ## Adding contextual-editing to a page


  To add contextual editing to a page, you'll need to hydrate the pages data. In
  React, this is done by [using the `useTina`](/docs/contextual-editing/react
  "") hook. We are currently working on adding support for other frameworks such
  as [vue](/docs/contextual-editing/vue "").
